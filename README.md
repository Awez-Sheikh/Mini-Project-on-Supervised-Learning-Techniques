# Mini-Project-on-Supervised-Learning-Techniques
1. This project uses the Wine Quality dataset, which contains various physicochemical properties of red and white wine samples, such as acidity, alcohol content, sugar levels, pH, and more. The dataset includes quality ratings for each wine sample on a scale from 0 to 10. The primary objective is to build machine learning models that predict the quality category of wine based on these features.
2. The project involves data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, checking for duplicates, and encoding categorical variables if necessary. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand feature distributions, relationships, and detect any outliers that may affect model performance.
3.Three classification algorithms are applied: Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes (NB).

*. Decision Tree builds a tree-like model of decisions, splitting data based on feature values to classify wine quality.
*. Logistic Regression models the probability of wine quality classes using a logistic function, suitable for binary or multiclass classification.
*. Naive Bayes applies Bayes’ theorem with an assumption of feature independence to predict class probabilities.

Each model’s performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure classification effectiveness. Finally, the models are compared to identify the best classifier for predicting wine quality, aiding winemakers in making informed production decisions.
